The “artist” of a compilation album can be a special value like “Various Artists”. You can also assume that each song is associated with a single album, but that multiple copies of the same song (which are included in different albums) can exist.\n",

    "A very common use case for inheritance is the creation of a custom exception hierarchy. Because we use the class of an exception to determine whether it should be caught by a particular except block, it is useful for us to define custom classes for exceptions which we want to raise in our code. Using inheritance in our classes is useful because if an except block catches a particular exception class, it will also catch its child classes (because a child class is its parent class). That means that we can efficiently write except blocks which handle groups of related exceptions, just by arranging them in a logical hierarchy. Our exception classes should inherit from Python’s built-in exception classes. They often won’t need to contain any additional attributes or methods.\n",

    "## Abstract classes and interfaces exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In some languages it is possible to create a class which can’t be instantiated. That means that we can’t use this class directly to create an object – we can only inherit from the class, and use the subclasses to create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we want to do this? Sometimes we want to specify a set of properties that an object needs to have in order to be suitable for some task – for example, we may have written a function which expects one of its parameters to be an object with certain methods that our function will need to use. We can create a class which serves as a template for suitable objects by defining a list of methods that these objects must implement. This class is not intended to be instantiated because all our method definitions are empty – all the insides of the methods must be implemented in a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract class is thus an interface definition – some languages also have a type of structure called an interface, which is very similar. We say that a class implements an interface if it inherits from the class which specifies that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we can’t prevent anyone from instantiating a class, but we can create something similar to an abstract class by using NotImplementedError inside our method definitions. For example, here are some “abstract” classes which can be used as templates for shapes:\n",

    "Write an “abstract” class, `Box`, and use it to define some methods which any box object should have: `add`, for adding any number of items to the box, `empty`, for taking all the items out of the box and returning them as a list, and `count`, for counting the items which are currently in the box. Write a simple `Item` class which has a `name` attribute and a `value` attribute – you can assume that all the items you will use will be `Item` objects. Now write two subclasses of `Box` which use different underlying collections to store items: `ListBox` should use a `list`, and `DictBox` should use a `dict`.\n",

    "Write a function, `repack_boxes`, which takes any number of boxes as parameters, gathers up all the items they contain, and redistributes them as evenly as possible over all the boxes. Order is unimportant. There are multiple ways of doing this. Test your code with a `ListBox` with 20 items, a `ListBox` with 9 items and a `DictBox` with 5 items. You should end up with two boxes with 11 items each, and one box with 12 items."
